## Description
This is a simply daily planner app which allows the user to save events. It runs within the browser and uses the following technologies:
-HTML
-CSS
-Moment.js
-Javascript
-jQuery

## How it works
The User would like a daily planner to help plan for a busy workday. The user has a set of timeblocks(7am-5pm) that they can enter tasks into. 

When the user enters a tasks they can hit the save button which holds that information into local storage. 

When the user refreshes the page the data will persist in the window.
